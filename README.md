## Preface

This test suite is derived from the C++ *ColoReduce MT-2018* project. It is *strongly recommended* to understand the C++ build/debug process, and use this only as a helper to double-check your work. Experiment with your own build/test scripts!

While providing out-of-the-box support for the *Speleo* project, the build/test scripts can easily be modified to support most simple C++ projects.

### ‚úÖ What this does

- üõ†Ô∏è Compiles your program with the official C++ compilation tool and [compilation flags](lib/compiler.sh)
- ü§î Compares the output *and* execution time of your program against the reference program
- ü§® Judges you.

### ‚ùå What this doesn't do

- üêõ Fix your bugs automagically
- ‚úèÔ∏è Write your program for you
- üòé Turn you into a pro-coder
- üßÆ Solve the *P versus NP problem*
- ü¶Ñ Make unicorns real

## Prerequisites

This tool is purely written in Bash, and works universally on most Linux systems (and probably also on WSL/emulators). The only required dependencies are the `g++`, `script` and `time` commands.

```bash
$ sudo apt install g++
```
<div align="center"><sub>This is most likely already installed on your system</sub></div><br />

## Installation

The recommended way to grab a copy of the test suite is to run `git clone`.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/MarcusCemes/speleo-test-suite.git
```
<div align="center"><sub>Type this in a terminal (without the "$") to download the suite</sub></div><br />

If you don't have `git`, you can also use the `Clone or download` ‚Üí `Download ZIP` button at the top of this page. This will not support updates.

## Usage

The test suite comes with all the standard *Speleo* tests and the reference demo program by default. To run the test suite, provide your source code to the `run.sh` script like so:

```bash
$ ./run.sh ../path/to/source.cpp
```
<div align="center"><sub>

You may need to add execute permissions with `chmod +x run.sh`

</sub></div><br />

This will compile your C++ code with the official compilation flags and stricter syntax enforcement, before executing the binary against each test and running the performance analysis.

You may add your own tests to the `tests/` directory. Each file represents a single test, and is piped to the program via `stdin`. The execution results, for manual inspection, will be generated under the `results/` directory.

## Performance Analysis

The performance analysis will score your program against a reference program. The Speleo binary is bundled by default, but this may be replaced with any other binary.

Each test is worth **3 points**. A negative score for your test will deduct from your total.

### Output correctness

The most important factor in the examination, verifying if your algorithm provides correct results.

- `+3` **Correct** - Your program outputs byte-perfect results.
- `+1` **Similar** - Your program has the same output with all spacing and new-lines removed. Maybe you're missing a new-line at the end?
- `+0` **Incorrect** - Your output did not match the reference output.

### Execution time

While not explicitly required by the regulations, a long execution time probably means there's something quite wrong and may result in your submission being terminated pre-maturely for safety reasons.

- `+0` **Negligible** - If the reference program is faster than 100ms.
- `+0` **Faster** - Your program was faster than the reference program!
- `+0` **Acceptable** - Your program was 1-2x slower than the reference program.
- `-2` **Too slow** - Your program was more than 2x slower than the reference program!

## Updating

The `run.sh` script can automatically update itself. If prompted, the script will automatically download new commits from GitHub and pull the changes into the repository using `git pull`.

In order for the auto-update function to work, you must have downloaded the repository using `git clone`. This will correctly initialize the the `remote` branch.

If you have messed something up, you can revert all local changes and re-synchronize yourself with GitHub by running the following:

```bash
$ git reset --hard origin/master
```
<div align="center"><sub>‚ö† This will delete ALL modifications you may have made! Be warned! ‚ö†</sub></div><br />

To skip updates altogether, such as when making your own changes to avoid merge conflicts, you can do pass a second parameter as shown below. You can manually update by running `git pull`.

```bash
$ ./run.sh code.cpp --no-update
```

## Contributing

This was written as my own collection of automation scripts, which I decided unify, document and share with others as a result of the amount of work I put into it.

This is in no way an official evaluation, just a handy helper to make your life a bit easier. Don't rely solely on this.
